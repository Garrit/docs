Garrit Documentation
====================

This repository contains specifications and high-level documentation for
Garrit. Its release versions are tied to those of the
[`java-common`](https://github.com/Garrit/java-common) project, as that project
contains concrete implementations of the data structures specified within the
Garrit spec.

The documentation is provided as LaTeX source. The packages required for
compilation are all included in [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). To
build all documents, invoke the makefile:

```
make
